# CodeAlpha_HangmanGame
This is a simple text-based Hangman game developed as part of the CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship. The goal of this project is to apply fundamental Python concepts to build an interactive command-line game where the user guesses a randomly selected word one letter at a time.
#  Hangman Game — CodeAlpha Internship Task 1

## Features
- Uses a **list of 5 predefined tech-related words**
- Random word selection using Python’s `random` module
- Allows **up to 6 incorrect guesses**
- Console-based interface with clear prompts
- Tracks and displays correct and incorrect guesses

##  Concepts Used
- `random` module
- `while` loop
- `if-else` statements
- Lists and strings
- User input/output (`input()` and `print()`)

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Download or clone this repository.
