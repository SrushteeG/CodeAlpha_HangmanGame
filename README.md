# CodeAlpha_HangmanGame
This is a simple text-based Hangman game developed as part of the CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship. The goal of this project is to apply fundamental Python concepts to build an interactive command-line game where the user guesses a randomly selected word one letter at a time.
